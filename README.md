# LA DOLCE VITA - Medium-Fidelity Prototype

## Project Overview
LA DOLCE VITA is an initiative designed to help young Italians and people of Italian descent living abroad maintain and emotionally reconnect with their cultural heritage through family rituals, food, and storytelling. The platform combines YouTube video content with a custom mobile application to create a comprehensive cultural experience.

## Prototype Information
This is a medium-fidelity prototype with grayscale design that focuses on information architecture, interaction flows, and basic visual hierarchy. The prototype is designed to be viewed on both mobile and desktop devices.

## Deployment
This prototype is designed to be deployed on GitHub Pages. The repository includes a GitHub Actions workflow that will automatically deploy the prototype when changes are pushed to the main branch.

## Target Population
- **Primary:** Italians living abroad (18-35 years old)
- **Secondary:** Second-generation Italians with limited connection to their heritage
- **Tertiary:** Non-Italians interested in authentic Italian culture

## Context of Use
Users would engage with the app in various scenarios:
- During daily commutes (motto feature, audio content)
- When seeking cultural connection (video content, events)
- While planning Italian meals or gatherings (recipes, traditions)
- To find authentic Italian experiences in their area (events, community)

## Tasks to Evaluate

### Task 1: Find and Engage with Cultural Content
Starting from the home screen, navigate to the YouTube section, find and watch the "Italian Gestures Explained" video, and interact with it.

**Steps to complete:**
1. From the home screen, tap "Videos" tab in the navigation
2. Find the "Italian Hand Gestures" video
3. Tap on the video to watch it

### Task 2: Access and Understand the "Motto of the Day"
From the home screen, access today's motto "La vita è bella!", view its detailed explanation, and save it to favorites.

**Steps to complete:**
1. From the home screen, view the "Motto of the Day" section
2. Tap "Mottos" tab to go to the motto list
3. Find and tap on "La vita è bella!" in the list
4. Tap the heart icon to save the motto to favorites

### Task 3: Redeem Points for Cultural Event Access
Navigate to the Rewards section, find the "Italian Cooking Class" event, and redeem points to participate.

**Steps to complete:**
1. From any screen, tap the "Rewards" tab in the bottom navigation
2. Find the "Italian Cooking Class" reward
3. Tap on it to view details
4. Tap "Redeem" to use points and join the event
5. View the confirmation screen

## Prototype Limitations
- Limited content library (representative samples only)
- User authentication is assumed (no login flow)
- Points accumulation logic is not fully implemented
- The prototype is primarily in English with Italian samples

## Design Notes
This medium-fidelity prototype uses grayscale design to focus attention on navigation flow and information architecture without the distraction of color.

The major improvements from our paper prototype include:
1. Simplified navigation structure with clear categorization
2. Enhanced cultural context for Italian content
3. Streamlined event registration process
