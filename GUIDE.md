## Nielsen's Heuristics for Evaluation

When evaluating, please consider these heuristics:

1. **Visibility of system status**: Does the system keep users informed?
2. **Match between system and real world**: Does the system speak the user's language?
3. **User control and freedom**: Can users undo mistakes easily?
4. **Consistency and standards**: Are words, situations, and actions consistent?
5. **Error prevention**: Does the design prevent errors?
6. **Recognition rather than recall**: Are elements visible and recognizable?
7. **Flexibility and efficiency of use**: Are there shortcuts for experienced users?
8. **Aesthetic and minimalist design**: Is there visual clarity and focus?
9. **Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors**: Are error messages helpful?
10. **Help and documentation**: Is there adequate guidance?

## Recording Your Evaluation

Please document the following for each task:

1. Usability issues encountered
2. The heuristic(s) violated
3. Severity of the issue (1-4, with 4 being most severe)
4. Suggestions for improvement

## Specific Areas to Focus On

1. **Navigation flow**: Is it intuitive to move between app sections?
2. **Cultural context**: Do Italian cultural elements have sufficient explanation?
3. **Interaction feedback**: Is it clear when an action is successful?
4. **Task completion**: Can all tasks be completed without confusion?
